# Login Page

This project is the front-end of a functional login page, developed in Angular and some more libraries from Angular itself were added, such as ngx-toastr and animations.

It is complemented with the backend that, through spring security, performs token validations for a valid login.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/login`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Back-end

The backend of the application is the repository called login-auth-api, just run it locally
